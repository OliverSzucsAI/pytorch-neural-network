# pytorch-neural-network

This repository contains a simple neural network built with **PyTorch**, designed for educational purposes. The project includes implementations of neural networks using popular datasets like **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** to help users understand the basics of machine learning and deep learning with PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to train a neural network on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. The network uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which are widely used for image recognition tasks.

### Features:
- Basic neural network implementation for **MNIST** dataset.
- CNN model for **CIFAR-10** dataset.
- Data augmentation techniques like random rotation and affine transformations.
- Optimized for learning purposes and hands-on experience with PyTorch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- PyTorch 1.9.0+
- torchvision 0.8.2+
- numpy
